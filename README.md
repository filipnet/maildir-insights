# maildir-stats
Useful statistical output of Maildir user mailboxes 

Getting an overview of the usage of user mailboxes can be useful for many purposes 

- Resource planning and trend analysis 
- Introducing quotas 
- Planning and completeness checks for migrations 

to name but a few. 

I created this script to migrate a Dovecot dsync cluster node for validation after replication.
